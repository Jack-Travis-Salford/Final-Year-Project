# Final Year Project
Salford University Year 3 - Final Year Project.

 This repo contains a build of my final year project, my dissertation, the poster/PowerPoint used for the project showcase, and the scripts used in said project. Due to file size restrictions, the whole project could not be uploaded. If the whole project is wanted, please email me @jacktrav28@gmail.com to receive a temporary download link, which sould contain everything that is required to open and run the project.


 For my final year project, I attempted to procedurally generate a 3D map, that would be suitable for a dungeon crawler/rouge-like game. This was accomplished using Unity (version 2021.3.5f), written in C#. 

 The included executible launches the app, which allows you to test the procedural generator, allowing for the customisation of certain variables that effect the generation process. The user may view the generated map by walking around it, or using a no-clip camera.
